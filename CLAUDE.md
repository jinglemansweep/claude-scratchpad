# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal repository called "claude-scratchpad" that appears to be a development workspace or experimental area. The repository is licensed under GPL-3.0.

## Repository Structure

The repository currently contains minimal files:
- Basic documentation files (README.md, docs/index.md) - currently empty
- Standard licensing (LICENSE - GPL-3.0)
- This guidance file (CLAUDE.md)

## Development Environment

This appears to be a fresh or experimental repository with no established build system, dependencies, or development toolchain yet. When working in this repository:

- Check for the presence of package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, or other dependency files before assuming available libraries
- Look for established patterns in any future code additions
- Follow standard practices for whatever technology stack gets added

## Git Workflow

- Main branch: `main`
- Repository is clean with minimal commit history
- Follow standard Git practices for commits and branching

## Notes

Since this is a minimal repository, future development will establish the actual technology stack, build processes, and architectural patterns. Update this file as the project evolves.
